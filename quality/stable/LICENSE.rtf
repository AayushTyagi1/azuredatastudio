For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:\par

\pard\cbpat6\widctlpar\fi-360\li1440\sb100\sa100\b a.\tab Australia.\b0\~You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.\par

\pard\cbpat6\widctlpar\li1440\sa150 Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.\par

\pard\cbpat6\widctlpar\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\b 11.\tab DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed \ldblquote as-is.\rdblquote\~You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.\b0\par

\pard\cbpat6\widctlpar\fi-360\li720\sa150\b 12.\tab LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.\par
