# Azure Data Studio AI Documentation Generator

The Azure Data Studio AI Documentation Generator is an extension designed to automate the process of generating comprehensive database documentation using artificial intelligence. This tool simplifies the task of creating detailed database diagrams and provides explanations for tables, relationships, and fields within the tables.

The resulting documentation is saved in a markdown file format, allowing authorized users to easily access and make edits as needed.
